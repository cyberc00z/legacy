 * BANKER'S ALGORITHM => it's a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm in operating systems.
 * n = processes in system
 * m = number of resources types
 
 *     Banker's Algorithm consists of safety algo and Resource Request Algo.
 *  
 *  SAFETY ALGORITHM
 * How to find out whether system is in a s-state(safe state) or not:?
 *  1. Let work and Finish be vectors of length m and n respectively:
 *      initialize: Work = Avaiable
 *      Finish[i] =false; for i=1,2,3,4...n (i is index)
 *
 *  2. Find an i such that both
 *    a. Finish[i] = False
 *    b. Need(i) <= Work
 *    if no such i exists goto step(4)
 *
 *  3. Work = Work + Allocation[i]
 *     Finish[i] = true
 *     goto step (2) 
 *
 *  4. if Finish[i] = true or all i then the system is in a safe state
 *
 *  RESOURCE REQUEST ALGORITHM.
 *   Request<i> be request array for Process P<i>
 *   Request<i>[j] = K means processP<i> wants k instances of resource type R<j> 
 *   SO BASICALLY WHEN A REQUEST FOR RESOURCES IS MADE BY PROCESS P<i> , following actions will take place:
 *
 *
 *   1.   Request<i> <= Need<i>
 *     Goto Step (2); otherwise raise an error condition;
 *     since the process has exceeded it's maximum claim.
 *
 *  2.  if Request<i> <= Avaiable
 *      Goto step(3); otherwise P<i> must wait, since the resources are not available
 *
 * 3.  Have the system pretend to have allocated the requested to process P<i> by modifying the state as follows:
 * Avaiable = Available - Request<i>
 * Allocation<i> = Allocation<i> + Request<i>
 * Need<i> = Need<i> - Request<i>

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * First initialize with work = avaiable, then if need > work then Finish is false and Process must be wait
 * otherwise if
 *              work > need
 *                       then Finish is True and
 *                       Process must be in safe squence
 *
 *  New Work after every True in Finish index
 *  New Work = Work + Allocation<n>
 *     
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What will happen if process P1 requests one additional instance of resource
 * type A and two instances of resource type C?
 *
 * Use Resource Request Algorithm:
 *                         if request<i> <= Need<i>:
 *                                     then if request<i> <= Available<i>
 *                                      then
 *                                           Avaiable = Avaiable - Request<i>
 *                                           Allocation<i> = Allocation<i> + Request<i>
 *                                           Need<i> = Need<i> - Request<i> 
 *                                                 
 *
 *           TO DECIDE WHETHER THE REQUEST IS GRANTED WE USE :
 *            Request<i> < Need<i>
 *            Request<i> < Avaiable
 *
